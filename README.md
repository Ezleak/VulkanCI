This repo publishes releases for enabling testing of Vulkan applications in GitHub workflows. It was created for integration testing of [NcEngine](https://github.com/NcStudios/NcEngine) but may be useful for more general use. Releases are tagged with the corresponding VulkanSDK version. Contents include:
- SwiftShader
- Vulkan-Headers
- Vulkan-Loader
  - built with LOADER_USE_UNSAFE_FILE_SEARCH=ON
- Vulkan-ValidationLayers

Integrating the Vulkan components requires the usual path/environment setup (VULKAN_SDK, VK_LAYER_PATH for validation layers, etc.). For Windows, the loader, validation layers, and layer manifest are in `<sdk-path>/<version>/bin`. For Linux, the loader and layers are in `<sdk-path>/<version>/lib`, while the layer manifest is in `<sdk-path>/<version>/share/vulkan/explicit_layer.d`. 

SwiftShader is expected to be found through the `VK_ICD_FILENAMES`/`VK_DRIVER_FILES` environment variable (certain use cases may take a simpler approach, see the [docs](https://github.com/google/swiftshader)), which should point to a driver manifest file. While this manifest is generated by the SwiftShader build, it isn't included here because it contains relative paths, which complicate usage. The manifest should look something like:
```json
{
  "file_format_version": "1.0.0",
  "ICD": {
    "library_path": "<sdk-path>/<version>/swiftshader/libvk_swifshader.so",
    "api_version": "1.0.5"
  }
}
```

The manifest can then be pointed to with
```
export VK_DRIVER_FILES="<manifest-path>/vk_swiftshader_icd.json"
```

Make sure the driver library can be located by the system, e.g.
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<sdk-path>/<version>/swiftshader"
```
